# Authentication

This is just a practice where I do used of 'jwt' and validation from the localStorage 
for a session in the page.

In the page you only need have an account and sing in and you can watch the animals.
You can create and delete the animals, only that, no more.

For this project we need to install the next libraries: 

- moongose
- express
- jwt
- express-jwt


## Environment Variables

I need to configure the .env
For the moment you need to create the Environment Variables in the local machine.

The Environment Variable is: 

`SECRET`

You can make this Variables so: 

`export SECRET=secretword`

In git bash.
